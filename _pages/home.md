## About
<a class="anchor" name="/about"></a>

I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Interactive Computing][gt-ic] at [Georgia Tech][gt] and a Research Scientist at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)][fair] in Menlo Park, CA.

From 2013 to 2016 I was an Assistant Professor in the [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering][vt-ece] at [Virginia Tech][vt]. From 2009 to 2012 I was a Research Assistant Professor at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)][ttic], a philanthropically endowed computer science academic institute on the [University of Chicago][uoc] campus. I received my Ph.D. and MS. from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] in 2009 and 2007 respectively. My advisor was [Prof. Tsuhan Chen][tsuhan] (now Dean
of the [College of Engineering][coe-ntu] at [Nanyang Technological University][ntu] in Singapore). I got my BS, also in [ECE][rowan-ece], at [Rowan University][rowan] in 2005, where I worked with [Dr. Robi Polikar][polikar] on several pattern recognition problems.

I've spent several months at:
- [Robotics Institute (RI)](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml) (Visiting Research Assistant Professor, Summer 2012) collaborating with [Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ehebert/)
- [CSAIL](http://www.csail.mit.edu/), [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/)(Visiting Scientist, Spring 2011)collaborating with [Antonio Torralba](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/) and [Aude Oliva](http://cvcl.mit.edu/aude.htm)
- [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) (Research Fellow, Fall 2010) collaborating with [Kristen Grauman](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Egrauman/)
- [Microsoft Research (Redmond)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/default.aspx) (Visiting Researcher, Summer 2010, 2015; Research Intern, Summer 2008) collaborating with [Larry Zitnick](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/larryz/)
- [Microsoft Research (Redmond)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/default.aspx) (Research Intern, Summer 2007) working with [Gavin Jancke](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/gavinj/)
- [Intel Research (Pittsburgh)](http://pittsburgh.intel-research.net/) (Research Intern, Summer 2006) working with [Rahul Sukthankar](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Erahuls/)
