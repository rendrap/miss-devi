## About
<a class="anchor" name="/about"></a>

I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Interactive Computing][gt-ic] at [Georgia Tech][gt] and a Research Scientist at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)][fair] in Menlo Park, CA.

From 2013 to 2016 I was an Assistant Professor in the [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering][vt-ece] at [Virginia Tech][vt]. From 2009 to 2012 I was a Research Assistant Professor at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)][ttic], a philanthropically endowed computer science academic institute on the [University of Chicago][uoc] campus. I received my Ph.D. and MS. from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] in 2009 and 2007 respectively. My advisor was [Prof. Tsuhan Chen][tsuhan] (now Dean
of the [College of Engineering][coe-ntu] at [Nanyang Technological University][ntu] in Singapore). I got my BS, also in [ECE][rowan-ece], at [Rowan University][rowan] in 2005, where I worked with [Dr. Robi Polikar][polikar] on several pattern recognition problems.

I've spent several months at:
- [Robotics Institute (RI)][ri], [CMU][cmu-index] (Visiting Research Assistant Professor, Summer 2012) collaborating with [Martial Hebert][cmu-edu]
- [CSAIL][csail], [MIT][mit](Visiting Scientist, Spring 2011)collaborating with [Antonio Torralba][mit-torralba] and [Aude Oliva][mit-aude]
- [University of Texas at Austin][utexas] (Research Fellow, Fall 2010) collaborating with [Kristen Grauman][utexas-egrauman]
- [Microsoft Research (Redmond)][microsoft] (Visiting Researcher, Summer 2010, 2015; Research Intern, Summer 2008) collaborating with [Larry Zitnick][microsoft-larryz]
